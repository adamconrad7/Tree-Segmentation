# Tree-Segmentation
Setup:

   Create a directory called 'data' in the same directory as code, place TIFF files there.

   To install our project, first install Python3. Using pip, install the specified libraries listed in requirements.txt. This can be done from the console with a single line: 
      $ pip install -r requirements.txt. 
   The program also needs a JSON file and a folder containing the input image in the project directory. Once these criteria are met, the program can be run with the following command: 
      $ python main.py
